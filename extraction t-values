% input = contrast image created during first level analysis 
% indicating the contrast btw incongruent & congruent trials

% masking? NONE 
    % whole brain analysis done
    % later cluster of voxels extracted based on MNI coordinates reported in literature & neurosynth atlas
% p-value correction? NO
    % significance level = 0.01 -> every voxel that reaches this threshold will be taken into consideration
    % while selecting clusters later on, correction for multiple correction will be included 
% extent clusters? 10 
    % result output will only show clusters existing of 10 (or more) continuous clusters
    % selecting significant active clusters:   
        % i.e., clusters of voxels that were significantly more active during incongruent than congruent trials
        % only considering those clusters that reached the 0.05 significance level with the family wise error correction (multiple comparison)
